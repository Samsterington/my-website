                    <div id="codingStory">
                        <p>I was first introduced to coding in my Earth Science degree, where we used code to handle and display large amounts of data.</p>

                        <p>I immediately found a passion for coding and from then on, to focus my degree, I picked units where I could use code to improve and master my study. However, I noticed that many of my fellow students tried to avoid coding, many finding it too intimidating and difficult to understand or use. I blamed this on the highly numeric teaching methods that our professors used, where the results of our work would simply output long lists of numbers. This made it very hard to know whether your answer was right or not and in all honesty it was fairly boring.</p>

                        <p>In my third year I decided it was time to take my coding to the next level, so I began teaching myself new programming languages outside of my degree and also began coding in my spare time. I discovered and developed a more entertaining form of programming which I call 'Creative Coding'. The techniques I developed allowed me to display and explain all the fundamental aspects of coding in visual, dynamic and interesting ways.</p>

                        <p>Currently, I am a coding mentor and coach, helping others develop a skill and passion for coding. I do this via private individual sessions and also as an extra curricular club at Chesterton Community College. For work I also design websites and for my own enjoyment, make digital art and small computer games.</p>

                        <p>I grew up just outside of Cambridge and studied a range of technical and creative subjects throughout GCSE and A-Level. These included GCSE Art (A), Drama (A) and Statistics (A*), and at A-Level: Maths (A), Physics (A), Geology (A*) and AS Photography (A). I think it's really important to develop both your creative and academic minds over your education, as it was my combination of these two that allowed me to excel at university.</p>
                            
                        <p>I studied Earth Sciences at Bristol University graduating with a first class honours (78%), and was top of my year in both the second and final year. This I attribute entirely to the creativity I applied to my work, making sure my assignments were not just scientifically factual, but also entertaining and enjoyable to read. We forget our teachers and examiners end up reading hundreds of the same essays and work: approaching topics from a creative angle really pushes your work to new levels.
                        
                        <p>I encourage students to develop their creative thinking, applying it into our coding, then into school or college work and hopefully whatever endeavours their futures hold for them.</p>

                        <p>Outside of coding I have quite a few other endeavours and hobbies. I feel it's always good to keep busy and keep expanding your mind.</p>

                        <p>I work with <a class="textLink" target="_blank" href="https://www.tempertheatre.co.uk/">Temper Theatre</a>, a UK based Theatre Company that raises awareness about deforestation and defends the rights of the indigenous people effected by it. The company is paired with a charity called <a class="textLink" target="_blank" href="https://www.survivalinternational.org/">Survival International</a> and last summer we travelled to Peru to share our work at the heart of the deforestation struggles. </p>

                        <p>I've also worked at <a class="textLink" target="_blank" href="https://nrich.maths.org/">NRICH</a>, a team in the Cambridge University Maths Department that supports maths teachers in finding engaging ways to teach their students using games, problem solving and group activities. The work they do at NRICH is wonderfully creative and I strive to emulate  the amazing ethos I saw there.</p>

                        <p>I'm also a keen juggler and trampoliner in my spare time, always good to have hobbies that take your eyes off screens from time to time.</p>
