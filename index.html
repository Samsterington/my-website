              I was first introduced to programming at university. We were encouraged to use MATLAB rather than Excel for our data formatting,
              visualisation and analysis; and let’s just say I took to it like a duck to water. It was revolutionary, and
              that's not just because excel is rubbish (no offence to Excel developers), it made so much more sense to me,
              so I started picking course units where I could use these newly acquired programming skills. On the left are
              some MATLAB data visualisation I used for my GeoPhysics dissertation (got 90% a not so humble brag).

              In my last year of Uni I realised that MATLAB was only a tiny drop in the huge ocean that was coding, so as my first unassisted
              paddle into the great blue I decided to teach myself JavaScript. I began using a teach yourself app but that
              quickly became boring; however, via a heaven sent YouTube algorithm I was lucky enough to stumble across
              <a target="_" href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> an amazing visual library for Javascript that uses the HTML5 canvas to visualise code in the browser.
              I used it to make the background to this website.
              <br />
              <br /> My proficiency in JS quickly overtook my ability in MATLAB as I discovered Object Oriented Programming and
              I began undertaking my own coding projects. My favourite was a digitised version of the abstract board game
              Santorini (I wanted to try it out before buying it). Click on the image to have a go yourself.

          <h2>Becoming a Coding Tutor</h2>
          <span>After leaving uni, to fund my theatre ambitions, I started private coding coaching business, teaching kids aged
            8 - 14 using the same p5.js library that I used to teach myself JS as I found it a really engaging way to learn.
            I also ran a coding club at a local secondary school which accumulated in me disguising as an industry professional
            and mentoring a Go4SET team (a multi school STEM competition where groups complete a 10 week technical project).
            I helped the group create a web application where a user can track there spending and add a savings goal, the
            app then calculates where money can be saved. Click on the image try the app out.

          <span>In 2018 I start teaching myself full-stack web development, completing courses on HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, AJAX techniques,
            PHP and MySQL. I found that I preferred backend coding to front end as despite enjoying making fun engaging UIs
            I found that the true logic and problem solving is found on the server side (working out why a div isn’t freaking
            displaying properly isn’t my kind of problem solving). With these new skills I started building business websites
            for friends and family. Click on the images to be taken to these websites.

            Components that autogenerated A-level maths questions and worked solutions. I gained experience working in a
            team of developers: using Git and GitHub for version contro, running Docker to build the app and ran automated
            testing with Circle CI. Jumping into a half built react project was a daunting prospect as a fairly novice programmer,
            but throughout the year I gained an understanding how different parts fitted together to make the entire single
